# ðŸ§  100-Day AI/ML Project Roadmap

Welcome to the **100-Day AI/ML Project Roadmap**! This is a hands-on journey through 100 mini-projects covering everything from foundational machine learning to advanced AI applications and deployment. Perfect for building your portfolio, improving your skills, or just having fun with AI!

You can build **one mini-project per day** or take your time with bigger ones. Either way, this roadmap is designed to keep you learning and building consistently.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap Overview

This roadmap is divided into five phases:
1. **Phase 1: Foundations** (Days 1â€“10)
2. **Phase 2: Intermediate ML** (Days 11â€“30)
3. **Phase 3: Deep Learning Basics** (Days 31â€“50)
4. **Phase 4: Advanced AI** (Days 51â€“75)
5. **Phase 5: Real-World Projects & Deployment** (Days 76â€“100)
Each phase covers a different aspect of AI/ML, from the basics to more advanced techniques. The roadmap is designed to be flexible, so you can pick and choose the projects that interest you.
